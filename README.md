#### Aug first week 2022
This is a small project I started in August 2022 and finished within the first week. I collected some fonts on https://www.dafont.com/ and converted them into webfonts.

To execute, install packages within 'package.json' one by one to avoid errors, then run 'npm run startDev' for development on your terminal.
